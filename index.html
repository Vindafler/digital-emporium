W<br>elcome to the Emporium,
</div>
This website is serving as a data storage for my visual and literary projects. Feel free to browse its contents and download stored projects for personal and non-profit use.
<br>
Have in mind though that I only publish works that I deem worthy to be this way, by this I imply that there are many more pieces of artistry that are just awaiting the be finished or additional changes. And if you are an artist yourself, 
you for certain know what means "about to be finished".
<br>
<br>
In case you wish to discuss something related with the site or the art, I am open to conversation via Gmail or Discord, both of them can be found in <a href="biography.html"> Biography section</a>.
